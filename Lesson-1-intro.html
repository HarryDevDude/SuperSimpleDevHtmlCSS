Element
An Element is a generic term for each of the things that we're displaying on the web browser is called an HTML Element. Anything from the <button> to <p> paragraph of text and more. 


Tags
<button> </button> is a HTML tag. It is a what we're trying to tell the computer to create. A majority of the tags will have an opening tag and a closing tag with a </> slash.

The word < 'button' > is called a tag name. It tells the computer what kind of Element we're trying to create.


Atrribute
href="https://www.youtube.com/"
is an HTML Attribute. An Atrribute modifying how an Element behaves.

<a> without the "href" (Atrribute Name) is just a semantic Element with out a destination.


*The syntax rule for an Attribute is, you have to have a space between the attribute. You can have multiple Atrributes. Just add a space betweent them.

Example:
NO
<ahref>

YES
<a href>

Mutltiple Attributes:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">

you also need a value for the Attribute, =" ",
Attribute Value tells the computer what we're modifying to. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Link to YouTube</a> 
will now link somewhere with a desination, content and a closing tag.

All together:
href is an Attribute name that tells the computer we're modifying this to a destination and the ="" tells the computer where we're modifying 
it to: www.youtube.com. And the target="_blank" tells the computer we're modifying it from opening on the current page to new tab.
